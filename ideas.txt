Card Game Engine: War

Rust:
- Cards -> class
    - number values
    - type (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds)

- Deck -> class
    - holds the Cards
    - can be shuffled
    - can be split to players

- Two Players
    - hold cards -> array/list
    - take turn putting top card in the middle to compare -> if statement
    - if player 1 card is higher, player 1 gets card
    - else if player 2 card is higher, player 2 gets card
    - else, in the event of a tie, go to War
        - for war: one card face-down one face up then same logic
    - if at any point no more cards --> lose

    - Player 1 Deck, Player 2 Deck
